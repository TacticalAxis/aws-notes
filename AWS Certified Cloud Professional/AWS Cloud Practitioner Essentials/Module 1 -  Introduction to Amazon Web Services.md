- Machine LEarning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robot Development
- Video Production
- Orbital Satellites

**Fundamental Cloud Compute Model**
- Most systems centered around client/server model
- A client makes a request, and with permissions, the server responds to that requests
- In AWS, the server is an EC2 instance - an [[Elastic Compute Cloud]] Instance
- Sequence
	- User makes request to server
	- Server validates the request was legit
	- Server makes response
- In more mature systems, things can get very complex

Key Concept: *You only pay for what you use*
- You can always have many servers serving requests
- Demand isn't always high enough to justify running all the servers (peak demand & low demand)
- This is what happens in an on-prem environment
- You can't instantly triple capacity if required
- With AWS you don't prepay for services, therefore you don't need to worry about capacity constraints
- With a click of a button, you can scale up to more servers or less

**Cloud Computing**
Cloud Computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

On-demand delivery: Indicates AWS has the resources you need when you need them
*If you need 300 servers, you don't need to request it, you just scale it yourself
*If you need more space, just use it when required, and return it when you don't need*
*This flexibility isn't available on-prem*

IT Resources: this is a big part of AWS philospohy. AWS has so many products because businesses need them.

Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT
- If there is a product/service that is common among different businesses, then this is not a market differentiator
- For example: your business being better than another based on how well you install some particular software; in the same way keeping backups doesn't make you better than your competition
- Tasks that are common, repetitive, or time consuming, are what AWS helps us with so business can focus on what ma
