**Learning Objectives:**
- Summarise the benefits of AWS
- Describe differences between on-demand delivery & cloud deployments
- Summarise the PAYG (pay as you go) pricing model

**AWS Service Offerings**
- Compute
- Storage
- Network Scurity
- Blockchain
- Machine LEarning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robot Development
- Video Production
- Orbital Satellites

**Fundamental Cloud Compute Model**
- Most systems centered around client/server model
- A client makes a request, and with permissions, the server responds to that requests
- In AWS, the server is an EC2 instance - an [[Elastic Compute Cloud]] Instance
- Sequence
	- User makes request to server
	- Server validates the request was legit
	- Server makes response
- In more mature systems, things can get very complex

Key Concept: *You only pay for what you use*
- You can always have many servers serving requests
- Demand isn't always high enough to justify running all the servers (peak demand & low demand)
- This is what happens in an on-prem environment
-
