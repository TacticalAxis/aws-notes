**Learning Objectives:**
- Summarise the benefits of AWS
- Describe differences between on-demand delivery & cloud deployments
- Summarise the PAYG (pay as you go) pricing model

**AWS Service Offerings**
- Compute
- Storage
- Network Scurity
- Blockchain
- Machine LEarning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robot Development
- Video Production
- Orbital Satellites

**Fundamental Cloud Compute Model**
- Most systems centered around client/server model
- A client makes a request, and with permissions, the server responds to that requests
- In AWS, the server is an EC2 instance - an [[Elastic Compute Cloud]] Instance
- Sequence
	- User makes request to server
	- Server validates the request was legit
	- Server makes response
- In more mature systems, things can get very complex

Key Concept: *You only pay for what you use*
- You can always have many servers serving requests
- Demand isn't always high enough to justify running all the servers (peak demand & low demand)
- This is what happens in an on-prem environment
- You can't instantly triple capacity if required
- With AWS you don't prepay for services, therefore you don't need to worry about capacity constraints
- With a click of a button, you can scale up to more servers or less

**Cloud Computing**
Cloud Computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

On-demand delivery: Indicates AWS has the resources you need when you need them
*If you need 300 servers, you don't need to request it, you just scale it yourself
*If you need more space, just use it when required, and return it when you don't need*
*This flexibility isn't available on-prem*

IT Resources: this is a big part of AWS philospohy. AWS has so many products because businesses need them.

Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT
- If there is a product/service that is common among different businesses, then this is not a market differentiator
- For example: your business being better than another based on how well you install some particular software; in the same way keeping backups doesn't make you better than your competition
- Tasks that are common, repetitive, or time consuming, are what AWS helps businesses with so business can focus on what makes them unique

Over the internet: being able to access the resources through a console or programmatically

*Pay-as-you-go pricing: Pay only for what you use*

**Deployment models for cloud computing**

**Factors to consider when selecting a cloud strategy:**
- required cloud application components
- preferred resource management tools
- legacy IT infrastructure requirements

**Cloud computing models:**
- cloud-based
	- all parts of the application run in the cloud
	- migrate all existing applications to the cloud
	- design/build new applications in the cloud
	- e.g. a company creates an application purely in the cloud (virtual servers, databases, and network components)
- on-prem
	- deploy resources with virtualisation & resource management tools
	- increase resource usage using application management and virtualisation technologies
	- also known as private-cloud deployment
- hybrid
	- connect cloud-based resources to on-prem infrastructure
	- integrate cloud-based resources with legacy apps

**Benefits of cloud computing**
- trade upfront expense for variable expense
- stop spending money to run and maintain data centres
- stop guessing capacity
- benefit from massive [[Economies Of Scale]]
- increase speed and agility
- go global in minutes
